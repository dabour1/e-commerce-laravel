I have completed the required steps in the PDF file.

I used JWT for authentication.

I used guards and policies for authorization and did not use gates.

I used storage to save images.

I used the Vue framework to create the dront end pages.

I created factories and seeders to fill the database with fake data.

The database is ready to use as soon as migrations are run.

The code can be improved both in the front end and the back end, and some enhancements can be added. However, due to the limited time because of my graduation project, this is what I was able to prepare.


I look forward to receiving your comments and guidance eagerly to refine my skills and improve my performance.


Best regards.
